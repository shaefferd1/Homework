While searching online for an inpirational image, I wanted to find something that would not only speak on my future but also speak to my 
current situation. The image that spoke the most to me was a graffitti image that says "Trust Yout Struggle." I chose this image for two
main reasons. The first reason why I chose this image was because of the medium used to convey this message. In the image, the text was 
presented on brick, assuming maybe the side of a building. This message transformed a piece of a building into a piece of art that can speak 
to anyone who view it. As a personal reflection, I can carry inspiration and inspire other no matter what space I may be in. The next reason 
i selected this message was because of the message itself. I believe that when we go through times of transformation, we forget that part of 
the struggle is a part of success.
